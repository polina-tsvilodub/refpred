# Comparison Class Inference pilot

This is a forced-choice experiment on adjective comparison class inference.  Participants see either basic-level or subordinate context parades of animals or plants. They are told that their friend refers to another invisible parade member. This utterance is either in predicative or prenominal syntax, it either includes a NP or an anaphoric 'one'. The subjects have to rephrase this utterance by choosing one of the two comparison class options. There are 6 trials.

There are 16 conditions in this experiment:
1. Between-subject: prenominal or predicative syntax
2. Within-subject: all conditions here are randomly balanced (3 trials each):
    - referent size: big or small (e. g. great dane or chihuahua)
    - NP specification: subordinate label vs 'one'
    - context picture: basic-level or subordinate parade
