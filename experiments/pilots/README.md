This directory contains various pilots for the cogsci experiments.

* `np-prod-`* pilots are different pilots for Experiment 2 (NP free production).
* `cci-`* pilots are different pilots for Experiment 3 (Comparison Class Inference). `cci-congruenceXsyntax` is a post-cogsci pilot where participants see both congruent (Great Dane described as big) and incongruent (Great Dane described as small) trials of the type of the finalized cogsci Experiment 3 trials. This is to test the influence of the incongruent trials on the participants' comparison class flexibility.
