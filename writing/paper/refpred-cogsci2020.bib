@article{Bale2011,
	Abstract = {This paper evaluates three accounts of comparison classes -- sets that rel-ativize the interpretation of gradable adjectives, often specified with for -clauses as in John is smart for a linguist. The first proposes that such classes serve as an argument to a function that determines a standard of comparison. The second maintains that these classes restrict the domain of a measure function used to map entities to degrees. The third proposes that these classes limit the kind of individuals that participate in a binary relation. This relation is then used in the construction of a scale and a measure function. It is this third account that is most consistent with the empirical data. It can explain how comparison classes fix a standard of comparison, induce presuppositions concerning the comparative subjects, and induce incommensurability in comparative constructions. This empirical result for comparison classes is significant since it sug-gests that scales in the semantic system are built from and dependent on more basic relations between individuals.},

@inproceedings{Solt2009,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the role of comparison classes in the semantics of gradable adjectives in the positive form, focusing on the case where the comparison class is expressed overtly via a for -phrase (e.g. John is tall for a jockey). Two central questions are addressed: what in-formation does the comparison class provide, and how is this information integrated compositionally? It is shown that the standard of comparison invoked by the positive form can be analyzed as a range of values whose width is based on the degree of dispersion in the comparison class. Com-positionally, the comparison class can be analyzed as an argument of a null positive morpheme (contra Kennedy [13]), in parallel to recent pro-posals for the superlative (e.g. Heim [9]). The implications of the analysis for the choice between degree-and delineation-based analyses of gradable adjectives are discussed.},
