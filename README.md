## Experiments

The experiment folder contain all experiment files for this project. You can look at the experiments and preregistrations for CogSci 2020 [here](https://tinyurl.com/rcsyz9f). To run an experiment locally, clone the repo, navigate to the subdirectory of the respective experiment and run `npm install` on the command line (requires node.js). Then open the `index.html` file. All the experiments were created from the [magpie departure-point](https://github.com/magpie-ea/magpie-departure-point)

#### CogSci2020

This subdirectory contains all files for the experiments reported at Cogsci 2020.
* Experiment 1: `syntax-rating` directory. The stimuli can be found in `04_trials.js`
* Experiment 2: `np-production` directory. The subject-NP condition can be found in `exp1-predicative`, the predicate-NP condition can be found in `exp1-prenominal`. For both, stimuli can be accessed in `04_trials.js`
* Experiment 3: `cc-inference` directory. The stimuli can be found in `04_trials.js`

#### pilots

This subdirectory contains various pilots of the cogsci experiments.
